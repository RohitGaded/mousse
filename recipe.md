step 1
Combine cream, cocoa powder, espresso powder, almond extract, stevia, and sea salt in a large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until mixture is light and fluffy and holds its form. Transfer to a serving bowl or individual serving dishes.

step 2
Serve sprinkled with chocolate chips plus additional cocoa powder or espresso powder to taste.

my personal note for better experince
For a vegan version, substitute canned full-fat coconut cream for the whipped cream. Refrigerate overnight, and then cream only the solid top part of the can.
You can use vanilla extract in place of almond, if you prefer. Feel free to use your favorite low-calorie sweetener.
